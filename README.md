## About This Tool

Calculate total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for new vehicles based on your location and driving patterns. Lifecycle emissions include emissions from manufacturing, petroleum extraction and battery production (for electric vehicles), emissions from driving the vehicle (use phase) and end-of-life disposal. The methodology is based on research published in Smith et al., 2025.
