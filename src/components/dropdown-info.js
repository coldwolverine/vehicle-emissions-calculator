        This tool calculates the total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for
        new vehicle purchases by factoring in your location and driving
        patterns. Lifecycle emissions include emissions from: manufacturing,
        petroleum extraction, battery production (for electric vehicles),
        emissions from driving the vehicle (use phase), and end-of-life
        disposal.

          Begin by selecting your location and the two vehicle types you&apos;d
          like to compare. You can customize driving patterns by adjusting the
          city/highway split and electric driving percentage for PHEVs (Utility
          Factor), or use our default settings based on EPA and SAE standards.
          First, user must select location. Default are set for driving patterns
          using EPA and SAE standards. You can modify city/highwayâ€¦

          The heatmap results show lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (g
          CO2e/mile) for each vehicle option, including all emissions from
          manufacturing through disposal. Percentages compare emissions of all
          vehicles against your selected baseline vehicle. <br />
