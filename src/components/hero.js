        This tool calculates the total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for
        new vehicle purchases by factoring in your location and driving
        patterns. Lifecycle emissions include emissions from: manufacturing,
        petroleum extraction, battery production (for electric vehicles),
        emissions from driving the vehicle (use phase), and end-of-life
        disposal.

        Start by following these simple steps to compare vehicle lifecycle
        emissions:
        <ol className="ml-6 list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            <b>Select Location</b> by choosing your region to calculate accurate
            vehicle emissions. Your location affects both electricity grid
            emissions (based on NREL&apos;s Cambium projections for 134 regions)
            and temperature effects based on county-specific climate data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pick two generic models</b> to compare. Choose Vehicles by
            selecting vehicle class (Compact Sedan, Midsize Sedan, Small SUV,
            Midsize SUV or Pickup) and powertrain type (Battery Electric,
            Plug-in Hybrid, Hybrid, or Internal Combustion Engine).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Customize Use</b> by adjusting the city/highway driving split
            and, for PHEVs, setting the Utility Factor (percentage of electric
            driving) based on your charging habits. Not sure? Use our default
            settings based on EPA and SAE standards for typical U.S. driving
            patterns.

        emissions including vehicle production and disposal based on the GREET
